		<p> I am a research associate in the Google Brain team in Montr√©al. Previously, I spent a year at Geoffrey Hinton's amazing team in Google Toronto. I also had a brief stint at Latent Logic (acquired by Waymo), a self-driving car startup in Oxford.</p>

		<p> My research interests mainly revolve around Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), often with the goal of making RL methods suitable for real-world problems. I believe that deep RL can be improved by inheriting ideas from supervised learning.</p>
