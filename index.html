		<p> I am a 2nd year AI Resident in the Google Brain team in Montr√©al. Previously, I spent a year at Geoff Hinton's amazing team in Google Brain Toronto. I also had a brief stint at Latent Logic (acquired by Waymo), a self-driving car startup in Oxford.</p>

		<p> My long-term goal is to create robust artificial agents that can meaningfully interact with their environments. My research interests mainly revolve around (Deep) Reinforcement Learning (RL), often with the goal of making RL methods suitable for real-world problems. I believe that deep RL can be improved by inheriting ideas from supervised learning.</p>
